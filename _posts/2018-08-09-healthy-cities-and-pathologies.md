<span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion&#8217;s focus was the association between urban environment, inhabitants health and the commitment of the World Health Organization on promoting Healthy Cities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In face of the current global framework of cardiovascular and obesity issues, it is worth highlighting Professor Maria Ines&#8217; speech, showing health as a result of economic and social development, therefore, coming from the cross-over of diverse policies, such as housing, education, public security and public facilities. The inequality in territories social and urban development affects health of its inhabitants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to question health as expenditure or access to utilities and explore it as a result of an equation, which involves different variables and actors. We are dealing with urban space conditions, that means investments and public policies, but also with individual daily mobility choices. And that is exactly HUM project`s main research focus.</span>
