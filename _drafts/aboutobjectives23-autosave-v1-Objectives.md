The focus of the BRAZIL-UK Healthy Urban Mobility (HUM) research is on understanding the impact of personal (im)mobility on both individual and also community health and wellbeing. This is being studied in different neighbourhoods in Brazil and in the UK. We are developing a participatory approach to support and develop healthy urban mobility and to address health inequalities and injustice.

Key questions driving the study are:

  1. How is urban mobility accessed by different social-economic groups in different urban settings?
  2. What are the meanings attributed to different ways of moving by different social-economic groups in different urban settings?
  3. What is the experience of mobility by different social-economic groups in different urban settings?
  4. How do different settlement types and associated ways of moving impact individual community health and wellbeing?
  5. What are the implications for planning and design of neighbourhoods and cities in promoting healthy mobility?
  6. What are the implications of ‘seeing from the south’ for conceptualizing urban mobilities on a global scale?
  7. What are the benefits and challenges of involving residents and stakeholders in the co-production of research and policy outcomes?
  8. To what extent is the methodological framework developed applicable to a range of contexts in the Global North and Global South?
