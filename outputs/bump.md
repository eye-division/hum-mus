## Barton Underpass Mural Project (BUMP)

The renovation of the Barton underpasses was one of the top recommendations captured in the <a href="https://www.hum-mus.org/assets/HUM_Barton_Summary_Report_DIGITAL.pdf?_cchid=2378d933a66b5e4d3f1c79e1db0518c3">Community Priority Actions</a>. A coalition of local groups and young people worked with an illustrator and graffiti artist to design and paint a new mural in the summer of 2021. This video explains the process and the wonderful results.
