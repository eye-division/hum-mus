Understanding the impact of the Healthy Urban Mobility project is a vital part of the overall programme. In early 2020 we asked our Healthy Urban Mobility partners from Oxford their views on how the project had gone and what had been learned. We talked to community and campaign groups, participants, officers and councillors from the City and County councils covering the areas of community development, transport and public health. We would like to thank all those who contributed their time and thoughts to this process. It was not possible to include everyone in our final five-minute film, but it explains how the project helped wider understanding of the impact of personal mobility on health and wellbeing in Barton and Rosehill and wider lessons for the future. The long-term engagement of researchers with the community and with stakeholder organisations, along with the co-production of practical community action plans were seen as particular strengths of the HUM project.

We would like to thank Film Oxford for their excellent work filming, editing and producing this video.
